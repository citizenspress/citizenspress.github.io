I do not work in the world of technology. I do not code at work except maybe a little SQL work from time to time. However, I have been using GNU/Linux as a main desktop since sometime around 1998. I became an open source and free software evangelist at some point later that year and never looked back.



# Posts

I regularly post on other websites. However, I have never felt those spaces allowed for full immergence in issues of technology and my passion for amateur engagement with code.

At the beginning, I saw software as a tool to support the projects I was working on. However, I did not know at the time that the new tools I set upon to learn would have such a major impact on my life outside of just using them for this or that project. Learning to code and using some of the tools in GNU/Linux (can someone really learn all of them?) have allowed me to learn the good kind of patience and think more strategically and clearly about problems outside of the software universe.

# Politics of Software Development and Implementation

There is an important political economy to software.

Software has a growing impact on the economy and the broader society and from conceptual framework to production version and updates. Each part of its development is affected by the politics of those involved. Legislation regulates "intellectual property" and copyright of the code, funding directs and limits its development. Hackers write and have their own politics and are workers which adds another deeper dimension of that politics. End users put it into practise to ends sometimes not envisioned by the creators and owners. Just as in the production of art or building cities, software development lives in a dynamic ecosystem and history that expresses itself with all the accompanying contradictions and internal logic.

As software and "information technology" become ever more important and its use more normalised and obscured, it becomes increasingly important to understand its political economy. There are undisputed masters of this domain of software politics -- just as there are within any major component of society and the economy. However, it is the popularisation and application of this analysis that interests me. The main issue for me is how we can empower workers both in an outside the programming circles to understand and shape this politics to advance society in a direction that is informed, enlightened, democratic and in the interests of those that toil and progress.

If people are unaware of software's inherent political nature then the implementation and framing of it can be very contradictory and alienating. I have seen these contradictions undermine major initiatives and, in the long run, undermine the interests of those the initiatives seek to support. This is especially the case for those engaged in the struggle for social justice.
