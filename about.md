I do not work in the world of technology. I do not code at work except maybe a little SQL work from time to time. However, I have been using GNU/Linux as a main desktop since sometime around 1998. I became an open source and free software evangelist at some point later that year and never looked back.



# Posts

I regularly post on other websites. However, I have never felt those spaces allowed for full immergence in issues of technology and my passion for amateur engagement with code.

At the beginning, I saw software as a tool to support the projects I was working on. However, I did not know at the time that the new tools I set upon to learn would have such a major impact on my life outside of just using them for this or that project. Learning to code and using the tools in the GNU/Linux tool set (can someone really learn all of them?) have allowed me to learn how to better attack a problem and think more strategically and clearly about problems outside of the software universe.
