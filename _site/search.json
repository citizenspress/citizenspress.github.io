      "excerpt"		: "We use software constantly: on our phones, on our computers, in cars,televisions and other devices we use daily. The way software is made,however, remains foreign to most people. Many academics have tried torebrand the work done by designers and coders of software as “knowledgework” in an effort to set it apart from other types of work. Theknowledge work is separated simply because the end product is intangibleand the workplace is more geographically amorphous. Make no mistake,those hordes of coders and developers typing away at their computers areworkers just as much as the auto assembly line worker or the steel plantworker, and their conditions are just as oppressive."
