# Politics of Software Development and Implementation

There is an important political economy to software.

Software has a growing impact on the economy and the broader society. From conceptual framework to production version and updates, each part of its development is affected by the politics of those involved.

Legislation regulates "intellectual property" and copyright of the code, funding directs and/or limits its development. Hackers write code and have their own politics about sharing and community. In many cases software developers are workers and this adds another dimension to that politics. End users put software into practise to ends sometimes not envisioned by the creators and owners.

Just as in the production of art or building cities, software development lives in a dynamic ecosystem and history that expresses itself with all the accompanying internal logic and contradictions.

As software and "information technology" become ever more integral to daily life and its use more normalised and obscured it becomes increasingly important to understand its political economy. Of course, there are undisputed masters of this domain of software politics -- just as there are within any major component of society and the economy. However, it is the popular understanding and application of this analysis that interests me. The main question is how can workers become empowered both in and outside programming circles to shape this politics and advance society in a direction that is informed, enlightened, democratic and in the interests of those that work for fairness and progress.

If people are unaware of software's inherent political nature then the implementation and framing of it can be very contradictory and alienating. I have seen these contradictions undermine major initiatives and, in the long run, undermine the interests of those the initiatives seek to support. This is especially the case for those engaged in the struggle for social justice.
