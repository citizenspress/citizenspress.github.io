# Politics of Software Development and Implementation

There is an important political economy to software.

Software has a growing impact on the economy and the broader society and from conceptual framework to production version and updates. Each part of its development is affected by the politics of those involved. Legislation regulates "intellectual property" and copyright of the code, funding directs and limits its development. Hackers write and have their own politics and are workers which adds another deeper dimension of that politics. End users put it into practise to ends sometimes not envisioned by the creators and owners. Just as in the production of art or building cities, software development lives in a dynamic ecosystem and history that expresses itself with all the accompanying contradictions and internal logic.

As software and "information technology" become ever more important and its use more normalised and obscured, it becomes increasingly important to understand its political economy. There are undisputed masters of this domain of software politics -- just as there are within any major component of society and the economy. However, it is the popularisation and application of this analysis that interests me. The main issue for me is how we can empower workers both in an outside the programming circles to understand and shape this politics to advance society in a direction that is informed, enlightened, democratic and in the interests of those that toil and progress.

If people are unaware of software's inherent political nature then the implementation and framing of it can be very contradictory and alienating. I have seen these contradictions undermine major initiatives and, in the long run, undermine the interests of those the initiatives seek to support. This is especially the case for those engaged in the struggle for social justice.
