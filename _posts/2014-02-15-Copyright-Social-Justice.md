# Raising Consciousness on Copyright Issues


I have written previously about the importance of the [politics of software](http://citizenspress.github.io/articles/Politics-and-Software/) and fight for [less restrictive](http://citizenspress.org/editorials/copyright-academy) copyright [licensing](http://citizenspress.org/editorials/openaccess). I think that these issues are at the heart of helping to building a "commons" for ideas in their written form. Since copyright laws regulate ownership of intellectual property for software, written material, pictures and other works, it is important for social justice organizations to understand the politics of copyright as it relates to these areas.

Indeed, the politics of ownership and the production of documents and the production of software are not as unrelated as they may seem at first glance.

I argue that it is not good enough for social justice organizations to simply have a few copyright policy geeks understand these issues. Part of the fight for collective action and growing the space to engage in collective action comes from taking back control over the tools and words used to describe and engage in those spaces.

For anyone who has been involved in a social justice organizations, a lot of time can be put into discussions about avoiding contradictions of the content of our arguments and the actions that the organization takes. This is but one reason that raising the issue of copyright and intellectual property cannot be confined to fact sheets or internal briefing notes.

To build understanding of our place in the economy and society \(["consciousness"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_Class_Consciousness)\) it is important to understand the rules of the economy when it comes to ownership and how ideas are conveyed. The whole package -- [form and content](https://www.marxists.org/archive/pilling/works/capital/pilling2.htm) -- of the works that we produce take are important in making sure that we are not working at cross purposes and undermining the broader movement.


The purpose of the struggle for defining ownership of social justice works is not the struggle for an individualized ownership system. Instead, like the struggle for public ownership of property and social services, it is the struggle for the collective ownership of our ideas.

Understanding that we fight within certain social and economic rules -- like those that govern work and employment -- that we currently do not have a direct control of has long been part of the social justice movement. The purpose of our taking "ownership" of our work is so that ownership can then be given to all workers instead of it being owned privately. Depending on the copyleft license that is used, it can also ensure that future works and ideas that build on our ideas are not re-privatized and can benefit future generations equally.

Starting the conversation about copyright issues in the current context may be as easy as debating policy for copyright and start identifying less restrictive copyright \(i.e., [copyleft](http://citizenspress.org/editorials/copyright-academy#section-8)\) licences to cover your materials. Engaging in the democratic discussions to identify a less restrictive copyright licence for your documents and software code is where consciousness raising happens for many complex policy issues.

At the start of the discussion, raising the issues of ownership and rights to distribute social justice documents will seem a rather simple question. However, once a few questions are posed it will become obvious that different answers can limit or strengthen the movement.

Once a policy is democratically adopted through discussion and debate, marking each major publication where the regular copyright notice would go (e.g., on the inside front cover just under the address) is the next step. Further to this, a "for more information see this URL" should accompany the copyleft notice for anyone interested in how your organization came to this position.

While the impact of changing this copyright mark might seem small, topics of ownership and distribution (and citation or ability to modify) products of work can be used as part of a conversation about why issues as seemingly esoteric as copyright actually affect all workers.


# Questions of Copyright

Some questions to answer with regards to copyright and licensing of products that result from intellectual labour of your members and staff:

1. Many social justice organizations are not incorporated, who owns the copyright for documents created by staff and members?
2. Does your social justice organization have a permissive licence for all of its work? How do members, locals or public know they can copy, redistribute, reuse, re-purpose documents produced by your organization?
3. Would your social justice organization allow its copyrighted products be used by some other publisher to reproduce for profit and/or not-for-profit purposes?
4. What are the attribution requirements for works produced by your organization? Do they change depending on the work?
5. What copyrights or trademarks does your organization control? Does it own the trademark for its names and slogans? If not, how do we protect the your brand from private sector theft?
6. Should your organization explore policy to be specific about copyright on products it produces?
7. Should your organization explore the use of Creative Commons or other less restrictive copyright licences for its software and documents?
