Our world is seeped in technology and proprietary knowledge which
intersects with ever expanding parts of our lives. Much of this
technology and knowledge is protected by copyrights and patents that
bestow unfair monopoly rent powers to capitalists and undermine
community and innovation.

Thirty years ago a revolutionary hacker invented a process that
delivered software to the masses and has denied untold billions from
technology capitalists. The hacker's name is Richard M. Stallman (RMS)
and the concepts he invented were GNU and Copyleft. Free software,
GNU/Linux, Open Access publishing for science and copyleft licences like
Creative Commons have allowed us to share our work with the world for
free. The genius of the copyleft licence is that it is structured to
create a world of constantly free shareable content. Science and art
released under copyleft can free us from capitalist constraints: and it
works.

RMS created a community by writing a copyright licence that was less
restrictive and then using his passion to help build a community that
would build an opposition to monopoly capitalism. It is not an
exaggeration to say that his innovation allowed for one of the most
successful left-wing movements in history.

GNU gives workers control over the means of technological, artistic and
scientific production. Our call to you is this: can you identify ways in
which you have engaged with open-source technology and, more
importantly, will you consider adopting it more widely?
